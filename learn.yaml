name: Erling Haaland
shots: "43 in 10 games;25 on targets"
G+A per 90: ~1.47
What this tells us: |
  Haaland is scoring at an elite rate:
    13 goals in 10 league matches is outstanding.
    His shot accuracy is strong (25 on target from 43 shots) and his involvement (G+A per 90 ~1.47) shows impact beyond just scoring.
    The xG number suggests he is not just scoring from soft chances—he’s getting quality opportunities and converting many of them.

Caveats: >
  The numbers above are for league matches only; full-season totals (all competitions) may differ and are still evolving.
  Some sources provide slightly different figures (e.g., 11 goals in 8 matches for league) due to how they count matches, minutes, or competitions.
